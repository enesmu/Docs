Mbed is an online compiler platform. There is nothing to install, just log in and start coding!
One of the supported boards is Nucleo-F401RE, which uses the exact same microcontroller found on FEZ. Start with it to build and compile then follow the [STM32 bootloader](../tinyclr/loaders/stm32_bootloader.md) instructions on generating and loading DFU files. 

This video shows the steps needed to use Mbed (The FEZ and the BrainPad share the same hardware core).
