![G400S](../images/g400s_noborder.jpg)

Our Surface Compute Modules are surface mount embedded controllers and are ideal for harsh or high vibration environments.

Our SCMs and UCMs can be programmed using a variety of languages and development environments including our own TinyCLR operating system.  TinyCLR allows you to write programs using Microsoft's Visual Studio development environment and Visual Basic or C# programming languages.

A free version of Visual Studio is available.  Find out more on our [TinyCLR OS introduction](../tinyclr/intro.md) page.
