![G120 / G120E](images/g120_noborder.jpg)

G120 and G120E are .NET Micro Framework (NETMF) System on Modules.

* [Datasheet](http://files.ghielectronics.com/downloads/Documents/Datasheets/G120%20and%20G120E%20Datasheet.pdf)

## Using the NETMF software
We discourage the use of NETMF software on our products in favor for TinyCLR OS. [Read more](../legacy/netmf/intro.md) about the use of NETMF and TinyCLR OS.

## Using TinyCLR OS
If haven't yet, read about using NETMF devices [with TinyCLR OS](../legacy/netmf/intro.md#with-tinyclr-os)

### Loading Bootloader v2
1. Download the [bootloader file](../tinyclr/loaders/ghi_bootloader.md#g120)
2. Set the LDR0 and LDR1 signals low while resetting the board.
4. The PC will now detect a virtual serial (COM) device. If you need drivers, they are in the [NETMF](../legacy/netmf/intro.md) SDK.
5. Open any terminal software, we recommend [Tera Term](http://ttssh2.osdn.jp/).
6. Select serial and pick the COM port associated with your board.
7. Enter `E` and you will see back "Erase all memory! Are you sure?" now enter `Y`. (The bootloader is case sensitive)
8. Enter `X` and you will see `CCCC`... showing on the terminal.
9. Now go to `File` -> `Transfer` -> `XMODEM` -> `Send` and then check the `1K` option.
10. Select the bootloader file you have downloaded above.
11. You will see `File Transfer Finished Successfully`.
13. Reset your board, you are now running GHI Electronics bootloader version 2!

### Loading the Firmware

> [!Tip]
> First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once.

To activate bootloader v2, hold the LDR0 signal low while resetting the board.

Download the [G120 firmware](../tinyclr/downloads.md#g120) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../tinyclr/loaders/ghi_bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.
