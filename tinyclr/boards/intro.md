While TinyCLR OS can be ported to other devices, we are providing a ready port for a few popular boards.

One of the ports is for [**FEZ**](../../fez/intro.md), which is the official TinyCLR OS board. It will always have the latest and greatest and should be used as a reference for new ports.

## Firmware Update
The firmware needs to be updated to match the assemblies loaded by Visual Studio. If you see an error message about a checksum error then your project's assemblies version does not match the veriosn loaded on the device.

Each board will have details on how to load its firmware.

## Other Supported Devices
Our SCM, UCM, and FEZ products all support TinyCLR OS. We also support boards made by other manufacturers.  For information about some of the third party boards we support, please follow the links below.
