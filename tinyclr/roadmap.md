# Roadmap

![Roadmap](images/road.jpg)

Below is an outline of our goals for a stable and production-ready 1.0 release of TinyCLR OS. Of course, this is subject to change and does not include many smaller improvements and features.

## v0.8.0 in February
- A Cortex-M7 build of the core library
- Low-level STMicroelectronics WiFi driver
- FEZ Hydra firmware

## v0.9.0 in March
- A .NET sockets and HTTP library for any interface (including ST's WiFi)
- Native driver for SPI displays
- Additional ports for other third-party devices

## v1.0.0 Release Candidate in April
No new features planned for this release. Instead it'll be a lot of final polish, bug fixing, documentation updates, and publishing in the online galleries. If all goes well, we're aiming for a final release in May.

While we will continue to support and fix bugs in 1.0, we're not done there! High on our list for 2.0 are several important features like file system, improved networking, in field update, more graphics, even easier interops, and USB host and client. We hope to get as many of these out as we can by the end of 2018. More details will follow after 1.0.

Longer term we do plan to investigate support for generics and, once we have that, alignment with .NET Standard.
