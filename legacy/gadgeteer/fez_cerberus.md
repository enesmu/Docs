# FEZ Cerberus

![FEZ Cerberus](images/fez_cerberus.jpg)

FEZ Cerberus is a .NET Gadgeteer product that utilizes .NET Micro Frameworks (NETMF). The core of FEZ Cerberus is the G30 System on Chip (SoC).

FEZ Cerberus is the mother of [the Cerb Family]().

# Using the Gadgeteer software
We discourage the use of NETMF and Gadgeteer software technologies on our products in favor for TinyCLR OS. [Read more](intro.md) about the use of NETMF, Gadgeteer and TinyCLR OS.

# The Boot Pins
PB10 is the MODE pin, which is used to select between USB and serial interfaces, for loader and for firmware. USART1 is used when in serial mode, that is PB6 and PB7.
LDR0 and LDR1 are PC1 and PC3 respectively. Setting LDR0 low on power up puts the device into bootloader mode. Setting LDR1 low will execute the firmware but will stop the application from running.

# Using TinyCLR OS
If haven't yet, read about using .NET Gadgeteer devices [with TinyCLR OS](intro.md#with-tinyclr-os)

## Loading Bootloader v2
1. Download the [bootloader file](../../tinyclr/loaders/ghi_bootloader.md#cerb)
2. Press and hold BOOT button down while resetting the board. 
3. If there is no BOOT button, there will be shunt-footprint labeled BOOT or LDR. Short the 2 pads with a wire while resetting the board.
4. The system will now detect an ST DFU device.
5. Read more on [uploading DFU files](../../tinyclr/loaders/stm32_bootloader.md#uploading-dfu-files) on STM32 microcontrollers.

## Loading the Firmware

> [!Tip]
> First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once.

To activate bootloader v2, set PC1 pin low.

Download the [Cerb firmware](../../tinyclr/downloads.md#cerb) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../tinyclr/loaders/ghi_bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.

# The Cerb Family
The FEZ Cerberus come in different form factor, together called the Cerb family. The entire family run the same software.

## FEZ Cerberus
