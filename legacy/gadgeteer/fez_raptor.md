# Using the Gadgeteer software
We discourage the use of NETMF and Gadgeteer software technologies on our products in favor for TinyCLR OS. [Read more](intro.md) about the use of NETMF, Gadgeteer and TinyCLR OS.

## Loading GHI Bootloader v2
Follow the exact same steps found on the [G400](../../scm/g400s.md) page.

## Loading the Firmware

> [!Tip]
> First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once.

To activate bootloader v2, press and hold the LDR0 button while resetting the board.

Download the [G400 firmware](../../tinyclr/downloads.md#g400) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../hardware/loaders/ghi_bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.
