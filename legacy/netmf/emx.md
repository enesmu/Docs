# Using the NETMF software
We discourage the use of NETMF software on our products in favor for TinyCLR OS, [Read more](intro.md) about the use of NETMF and TinyCLR OS.

## Loading Bootloader v2
> [!Tip]
> The bootloader version 1 doesn't always work with Windows 7 and newer (Error code 10). You can use the serial option to update the loader.
> This is a one-time procedure. You should have no issues after the bootloader V2 is loaded.

**To update using USB**
1. Download the [bootloader file](../../tinyclr/loaders/ghi_bootloader.md#emx)
2. Set EMX in boot mode, by making pins 3,7 and 53 low and reset EMX. (Pin3=P0.4 | Pin7=P2.5 | Pin53=P2.11)
3. The PC will now detect a virtual serial (COM) device. If you need drivers, they are in the [NETMF](../netmf/intro.md) SDK.
4. Open any terminal software, we recommend [Tera Term](http://ttssh2.osdn.jp/).
5. Select serial and pick the COM port associated with your board.
6. Enter `E` and you will see back "Erase all memory! Are you sure?" now enter `Y`. (The bootloader is case sensitive)
7. Enter `X` and you will see `CCCC`... showing on the terminal.
8. Now go to `File` -> `Transfer` -> `XMODEM` -> `Send` and then check the `1K` option.
9. Select the bootloader file you have downloaded above.
10. You will see `File Transfer Finished Successfully`.
11. Change the configuration switches back to the off position and reset the board.
12. You are now running GHI Electronics bootloader v2!

**To update using Serial**
1. Connect a development PC to COM1 on EMX, Pin5 and Pin6 (through RS232 converter or a USB-Serial TTL cable).
2. SET LMODE pin low.
3. Follow the steps above to load the firmware.

## Loading the Firmware

> [!Tip]
> First make sure you have bootloader v2 loaded. This needs to be done only once.

To activate bootloader v2, set Pin3 low (double check) and then reset your board.

Download the [EMX firmware](../../tinyclr/downloads.md#emx) and follow [Loading the Firmware](../../tinyclr/loaders/ghi_bootloader.md#loading-the-firmware) steps.
