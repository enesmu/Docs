![G400D](../images/g400d_noborder.jpg)

Our Universal Compute Modules are based on a 200 pin SO-DIMM form factor.  All models follow a standard pin out making it easy to change modules to fit the needs of your product.

Our UCMs and SCMs can be programmed using a variety of languages and development environments including our own TinyCLR operating system.  TinyCLR allows you to write programs using Microsoft's Visual Studio developent environment and Visual Basic or C# programming languages.

A free version of Visual Studio is available.  Find out more on our [TinyCLR OS introduction](../tinyclr/intro.md) page.
